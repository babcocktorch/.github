Good data is the foundation of language technology, but it's often hard to find for African languages. We're exploring different approaches to collect and verify language data, developing tools to identify different dialects, and creating efficient ways to gather high-quality examples. This work helps us understand what makes a dataset useful and representative.

### Learning Together

We believe in the power of shared knowledge. Our community brings together researchers at different stages in their journey - some just starting out, others with years of experience. We learn from each other, exchange ideas, and tackle challenges together. This collaborative approach helps us all grow while advancing the field.
